# Contributing to Goal: Partner. 🤝

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We appreciate your help and your time in making Goal: Partner. better.

## Project Vision 🚀

The philosophy is simple: **We're the only app that shares your goal: finding a partner and leaving the app as soon as possible.**

We're trying to build a dating platform that is transparent, fair, and respects everyone's time.

## Status: Standby ⚠️

**Please note that the project is currently on standby.** 

This means that active development by the core maintainer is paused. However, we are still accepting pull requests! If we see high-quality interest and high volumes of activity, we will resume active development of the platform itself.

## How Can You Help?

You can contribute in several ways:

1. **Bug Reports:** If you find a bug in the landing page, responsiveness, or translations, feel free to open an issue or, even better, a PR.
2. **Feature Suggestions:** If you have an idea for how to make the platform even simpler or more transparent, share your ideas in the issues.
3. **Translating:** We currently have Spanish and English. If you want to add a third language, we'd love to see it!
4. **Code Improvements:** Enhancements to accessibility, performance, or styling (Tailwind CSS v4) are always welcome.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork the repo** and create a new branch from `main`.
2. **Keep it simple:** Small, focused PRs are easier to review and merge.
3. **Respect the stack:** This project uses Astro 5 and Tailwind CSS v4. Please stick to these technologies.
4. **i18n:** If you add a new feature that includes text, please ensure you update both `src/i18n/translations.base.ts` (Spanish and English).
5. **Linting & Formatting:** Ensure your code follows the existing style for consistency.

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/goal-partner.git

# Install
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:4321`.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with the "Question" tag if you're not sure about something. We're happy to help!

Thank you again for your interest in helping build a different kind of dating platform. Let's break the paradox together!
